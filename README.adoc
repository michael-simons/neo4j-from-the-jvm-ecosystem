= Neo4j from the JVM ecosystem.

Examples of how to connect to Neo4j on the JVM, reading and writing data.

The idea of this project is to show how to access the standard movie graph and create a web api for it on different platforms running on the JVM.

All projects have been created either via their official "starter" services or Maven archetypes. 

NOTE: The order in which the frameworks is alphabetical and doesn't represent any preference.
      As I prefer Maven, I chose to create all projects as Maven projects.

https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-neo4j[Spring Data Neo4j 6] can be used inside a CDI container as well and is known to work in Liberty and Helidon.
We provide a CDI extension for that. You need to bring in an application scoped instance of the Neo4j Driver.
The portable CDI extension https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-dependency-injection/#extension-points[won't work in Quarkus].
So in case you really want to have great Object Mapping but cannot decide to use Spring as a container, 
you might want to try out the CDI extension.

Neo4j-OGM can work on GraalVM native since version 3.2.19 when you provide an index of the node entities.
The index must be in `META-INF/resources/name/of/your/package/neo4j-ogm.index`.
Also the entities in question must be registered for reflection (either through pure GraalVM `reflection-config.json` or through the means of your selected framework.)

The goal of this repository is to check and demonstrate what is necessary to achieve the following inside the current Java application frameworks and runtimes:

* Support a couple of "standard" use cases presented as HTTP Api, transporting JSON. This is a hard requirement
* See if they provide automatic setup of the Neo4j driver or at least a dynamic configuration mechanism to do this
* Check if there's an officially supported Data Mapping framework available for Neo4j.
  Having a data mapping framework layer is really nice to have, but if this is not possible, the Neo4j Java driver
  plays very well with custom mapping functions or things like https://mapstruct.org[MapStruct].
* Built-in dev-mode with reload / restart feature
* Dedicated support for optimized docker images (Preferable via the chosen build tool but a two step process via a dedicated docker file is ok)
* See if a Reactive Streams implementation is present and whether it works with the Neo4j Java driver
* See if the application can be turned into a GraalVM native image via the chosen build tool without
  fiddling around with `native-image` parameters

A red cross doesn't mean a given Framework is bad in anyway.
It is just an indicator that something either doesn't work without additional configuration or programming or is just not there.
An assessment whether a particular thing is needed or not is up to the reader and must be reasoned about in the context of the framework and it's actually present features.

All the frameworks used and tested here support the actual "business" logic.

=== Status / Health checks

==== Liveness

General Liveness of the application:

[quote,Spring Boot Documentation]
____
The “Liveness” state of an application tells whether its internal state allows it to work correctly, or recover by itself if it’s currently failing.
____

[source,bash]
.Example request
----
$ curl 'http://localhost:8080/management/health/liveness' -i -X GET
----

[source,http,options="nowrap"]
.Example response
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Mon, 16 Nov 2020 12:51:24 GMT
Content-Length: 21

{
  "status" : "UP"
}
----

==== Readiness

[quote,Spring Boot Documentation]
____
The “Readiness” state of an application tells whether the application is ready to handle traffic. A failing “Readiness” state tells the platform that it should not route traffic to the application for now.
____

We expect the Neo4j database connection to be taken into consideration for readiness.

[source,bash]
.Example Request
----
$ curl 'http://localhost:8080/management/health/readiness' -i -X GET \
    -H 'Accept: application/json'
----

./mvnw clean package -Dpackaging=native-image
# As a native docker image
./mvnw clean package -Dpackaging=docker-native
----

Micronaut offers `io.micronaut.core.annotation.Introspected` for classes that should be instrospected as Beans on compile time.
There is also `io.micronaut.core.annotation.ReflectiveAccess` to mark constructors, methods and fields for reflective access..

The Maven setup requires the `io.micronaut:micronaut-graal` annotation processor to correctly produce native image calls:

[source,xml]
----

=== Create docker images

(Extension `container-image-docker` must be provided once, via `./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="container-image-docker"`).

[source,console]
----
./mvnw clean package -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true
----

=== Create native images

[source,console]
----
# For your current system, GraalVM 11 is required
./mvnw clean package -Pnative

=== Health

Health infrastructure provided with Quarkus Smallrye Health (`io.quarkus:quarkus-smallrye-health`), *Neo4j included ootb*.
All paths can be easily configured (health separate from liveness and readiness).

Format of the individual Neo4j status:

[source,bash]
.Request
----
$ curl 'http://localhost:8080/management/health' -i -X GET
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "UP",
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "Neo4j connection health check",
      "status": "UP",
      "data": {
        "server": "Neo4j/4.1.0@localhost:7687",

== Spring

* ✅ Automatic setup of the Neo4j driver
* ✅ Officially supported Data Mapping framework available (SDN 6 for current, SDN5+OGM for older version)
* ✅ Built-in dev-mode with reload / restart feature
* ✅ Dedicated support for optimized docker images
* ✅ Reactive Streams: https://projectreactor.io[Project Reactor]
* ⚠️ GraalVM native compilation (Currently in beta, not part of a standard setup)
* ✅ Health (Liveness, Readiness and detailed status)

Demo projects provided:

* spring-plain-imperative
* spring-plain-reactive
* spring-data-imperative
* spring-data-reactive

Created via: https://start.spring.io, version tested: *2.4.0*.

There is an additional project, `spring-boot24-with-sdn-ogm` that does a bit work on the dependencies
so that people can use SDN+OGM with the most recent versions of Spring Boot.
The preferred way of using SDN+OGM however is Spring Boot prior to 2.4.

=== Configuration of the Neo4j Java Driver

Full support of all official 4.1.x config options under the namespace `spring.neo4j.*`. 
Basic setup:

[source,properties]
----
spring.neo4j.uri=bolt://localhost:7687
spring.neo4j.authentication.username=neo4j
spring.neo4j.authentication.password=secret
----

=== Running

[source,console]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

=== Testing

Easy setup of test connections (via `@DataNeo4jTest` and a custom `@DynamicPropertySource`). Can be used with Neo4j embedded test harness (as in the example) or with Neo4j Test-Containers.

=== Create docker images

[source,console]
----
./mvnw -DskipTests clean spring-boot:build-image
----

Similar tooling with the same features is available for Gradle.

=== Create native images

Provide the compile time dependency

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.experimental</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-graalvm-native</artifactId>
	<version>0.8.3</version>
	<scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
----

Adapt the build config like this 

[source,xml]
----
<build>
	<plugins>
		<plugin>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
			<configuration>
				<image>
					<builder>paketobuildpacks/builder:tiny</builder>
					<env>
						<BP_BOOT_NATIVE_IMAGE>1</BP_BOOT_NATIVE_IMAGE>
						<BP_BOOT_NATIVE_IMAGE_BUILD_ARGUMENTS>
							-Dspring.spel.ignore=true
							-Dspring.native.remove-yaml-support=true
						</BP_BOOT_NATIVE_IMAGE_BUILD_ARGUMENTS>
					</env>
				</image>
			</configuration>
		</plugin>
	</plugins>
</build>
----

And `./mvnw -DskipTests clean spring-boot:build-image` will create a native image. Tested with Spring Boot 2.4 and Spring GraalVM Native 0.8.3.

=== Health

Health infrastructure provided with Spring Boot Actuator (`org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-actuator`), *Neo4j included ootb*.

NOTE: Path to individual endpoints for `liveness` and `readiness` seems to be changeable with
`management.endpoint.health.group.live.include=livenessState`, but that feels not very intuitive.

Format of the individual Neo4j status:

[source,bash]
.Request
----
$ curl 'http://localhost:8080/management/health' -i -X GET
----

[source,json]
----
{
  "status": "UP",
  "components": {
    "neo4j": {
      "status": "UP",
      "details": {
        "server": "Neo4j/4.1.0@localhost:7687",
        "edition": "enterprise",
        "database": "neo4j"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

== TCK

I have created a TCK - basically a glorified end-to-end-test - that brings up each application and ensure it's expected behaviour.
You need bash, Docker and JDK 15 to run it:

[source,console]
----
cd tck
./run.sh
----

It will bring up a Neo4j docker instance and take each project, build a docker image, start it and than executes a couple of requests against it.
The script is tested currently only under macOS.

== Some numbers

All scripts to build, verify and benchmark the images are in this repository.
The path of least resistance (or effort) has been chosen to build the images,
JVM and native one, following the official instructions.

All tests have been conducted with https://github.com/apigee/apib[apib: API Bench] using the following options:

[source,console]
----
apib -c20 -d60 http://localhost:$EXPOSED_PORT/api/movies
----

The application was connected against a Neo4j container running on the same host:
The Neo4j container has been shutdown and restarted between each benchmark run.

apib fully supports HTTP 1.1 including keep-alives and chunked encoding.
Apache Bench cannot reliable benchmark the reactive infrastructure without it.

Time to readiness is the time from container start until the container reports `UP`
in a `GET /management/health/readiness`.
